# Contributing Guidelines

- Add single resource in one pull request as it will allow for easier review.

- Pull request title should include resource name and resource section.
  - Example: `[DeckLink Duo 2] -> [Hardware]`

- Provide a link to submitted resource in pull request comment section for easier access without copy paste.
  - Example: `Link: https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/industry/film-television`

- Double check if the resource is truly related to `Virtual Production` & `Unreal Engine` without any kind of hidden surprises.
